    "about":"Hello! My name is Maria, and I am a 27-year-old software developer originally from Ã‰vora, in the beautiful Alentejo region. \n My professional journey is unique; I began my career as a veterinarian, but my curiosity and love for challenges inspired me to trade my stethoscope for code.\nI am a resilient individual who thrives in environments that push me to learn and grow. \nMy background in veterinary medicine has given me a meticulous attention to detail and a strong problem-solving ability, both of which are essential in the tech industry.\nOutside of coding, I am passionate about the beach, traveling to new destinations, exploring different cuisines, and caring for animals. These interests not only enrich my personal life but also fuel my creativity and drive in my work.\nI am excited about the opportunity to bring my unique skills and experiences to innovative and impactful projects.
